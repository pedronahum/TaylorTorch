# Shape Utilities (Reserved)

This directory is reserved for future helper types that purely manipulate tensor shapes without introducing learnable parameters. Current shape-changing functionality lives in `Modules/Layers/` (Flatten, Reshape, Permute, Squeeze/Unsqueeze). Place any additional non-layer utilities here if they do not warrant their own layer type.
